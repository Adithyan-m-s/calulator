# Walkthrough - Modern Transparent Calculator

I have built a modern, responsive calculator with a glassmorphism design and smooth animations.

## Features
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass effect using `backdrop-filter`.
- **Smooth Animations**: Button scaling on hover, micro-interactions on click, and entry animations.
- **Full Functionality**: Basic arithmetic operations, keyboard support, clear (AC), and delete (DEL) features.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes.

## Design Highlights
- Vibrant animated background circles.
- Modern font ('Outfit' from Google Fonts).
- Hover and Active states for all buttons to provide visual feedback.

## Verification Results
I've verified the following operations:
- `7 + 8 = 15`
- `25 * 4 = 100`
- Deletion logic and clear functionality.
