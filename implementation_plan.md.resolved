# Implementation Plan - Transparent Animated Calculator

Create a visually stunning, glassmorphism-style calculator with smooth animations and robust functionality.

## Proposed Changes

### [UI/UX Design]
- **Glassmorphism**: Use `backdrop-filter: blur()`, semi-transparent backgrounds, and thin borders to create a "frosted glass" look.
- **Animations**: 
  - Button hover effects (glow, scale).
  - Button click micro-animations (pressed effect).
  - Modern transitions for the display.
- **Color Palette**: Vibrant background with soft, readable text.

### [Foundation]
#### [NEW] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/aaadi/OneDrive/Desktop/webpage%20desining/modern%20calculater/index.html)
- Semantic HTML structure for the calculator container, display, and buttons.
- Integration of Google Fonts (e.g., 'Inter' or 'Outfit').

#### [NEW] [style.css](file:///c:/Users/aaadi/OneDrive/Desktop/webpage%20desining/modern%20calculater/style.css)
- CSS variables for the glassmorphism theme.
- Responsive layout using Flexbox/Grid.
- Keyframes for animations and smooth transitions.

#### [NEW] [script.js](file:///c:/Users/aaadi/OneDrive/Desktop/webpage%20desining/modern%20calculater/script.js)
- Event listeners for button clicks and keyboard input.
- Arithmetic logic handling (evaluating expressions safely).
- State management for display updates.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- N/A for this simple project.

### Manual Verification
- Open `index.html` in a browser and test all operations (+, -, *, /).
- Verify responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- Ensure animations are smooth and visually appealing.
